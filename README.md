```
#### Training Models
* Found scripts_and_model_related_files
* Model training scripts are named starting with the model name followed by the data set or domain
* For Fashion MNIST, the scripts for training are: RAE_fmnist_final.py, vae_fmnist.py, WAE_fmnist.py
* For Cars, the scripts for training are: rae_stanford_cars_final.py, rae_stanford_cars_spectral_norm.py, vae_stanford_cars.py, wae_stanford_cars.py
* For implied volatility surface, the scripts are: RAE_Finance.py, VAE_Finance.py, WAE_Finance.py
* Note that the scripts depend upon the losses.py which contains user defined classes for the different models and spectral_norm_layers.py for SN
* Cars models depends upon cars_data_gen.py and cars_preprocess.py.


#### Model Evaluation
* Found scripts_and_model_related_files
* Model Evaluation for images are found in compute_fid.py which depends on fid.py, model_repo.py and inception.py 
  as well as the pretrained model file pt_inception-2015-12-05-6726825d.pth. Cars models depends upon cars_data_gen.py and cars_preprocess.py.
* Model evaluation for finance dataset are mae_eval_complete_vol_surface.py, test_recon_mae_and_gridbased_completion.py and finance_gen_check.py
* Due to file size limitation, some of the files like pt_inception-2015-12-05-6726825d.pth are uploaded on the google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J2onGDemUzY0jZ3kD4JGXH6voUvAip4N?usp=sharing

#### Trained Model files
* Found in the respective subfolders in the model_files directory.
